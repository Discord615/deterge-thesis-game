Now we know that you can atleast speak to a stationary object. Now let's get into a scenario. Say a person is sick, they would need to be administered the right medicine, why don't you try administering some medicine to that dummy.
Make sure to give it the right medicine of Paracetamol of about 500mg. If you give it the wrong dosage or the wrong medicine, you might need to resucitate the dummy.
