Doc, I've been having frequent headaches and a persistent mild cough
    + [Can you mention any additional symptoms?]
        I'm sweating a lot at night
            ++ [When did it start and how did it happen?]
                 It all began due to the poor ventilation in our classroom
                    +++ [It could be related to that]
                        What should I do?
                            ++++ [Take a rest]
                                Thanks doc, I'll do that right away
                                -> DONE
                            ++++ [Monitor your symptoms]
                                Thanks doc, I'll keep an eye on it
                                -> DONE
                    +++ [I'll conduct proper tests and diagnostics]
