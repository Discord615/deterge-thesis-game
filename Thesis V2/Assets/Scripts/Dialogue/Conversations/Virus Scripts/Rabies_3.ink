Doctor, I've been experiencing a bit of sweating
    + [Any other symptoms you've noticed?]
       I've also had dry and itchy skin.
            ++ [When did it start and how did it happen?]
                 I think it began after using the water dispenser
                    +++ [It could be related to that]
                        What should I do?
