Doc, I've had a persistent mild cough and occasional fatigue
    + [Can you mention any additional symptoms?]
       I've also noticed a slight loss of appetite
            ++ [When did you first notice these symptoms and how did it happen?]
                 It all began after regularly staying in a poorly ventilated classroom
                    +++ [It could be related to that]
                        What should I do?

                                Thanks doc, I'll do that right away
                                -> DONE
                            ++++ [Monitor your symptoms]
                                Thanks doc, I'll keep an eye on it
                                -> DONE
                    +++ [I'll conduct proper tests and diagnostics]
