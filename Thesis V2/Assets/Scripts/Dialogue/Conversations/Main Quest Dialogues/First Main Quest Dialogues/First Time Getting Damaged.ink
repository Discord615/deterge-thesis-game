Looks like your health was decreased. Thats probably due to the area you were in just now. Airborne viruses can get you sick if you aren't careful. You can get a mask somewhere in the clinic to reduce the amount of damage you receive from the virus.

Remember that you can also visit the sink near the infirmary to wash off the virus and get back the health you lost. Always ensure that you keep yourself clean when dealing with viruses to ensure that you won't infected as well.
