=== start ===
URGENT! We have report that a rabid dog was spotted near the school and has bitten a few students. Its undoubtably release by someone as some sort of last ditch effort. But don't worry, we have sent people over to take care of it now.

But Rabies is still a very dangerous thing to deal with and if not handle ASAP then there could be even more deaths. Find and get a sample from them ASAP. We still need to see if the virus can be cured by normal means.
